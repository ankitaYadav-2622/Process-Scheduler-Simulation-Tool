Project Name: Process Scheduler Simulation Tool

Description:
This project is a simulation tool for studying CPU scheduling algorithms.
It allows users to input processes with arrival times, burst times, and priorities,
and then simulate their execution using different scheduling strategies.

Supported Algorithms:
1. FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
2. DRF (Dynamic Response Factor)
3. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
4. Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)

Features:
- Interactive command-line interface
- Gantt chart visualization
- Calculation of Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Average Metrics
- Comparison of scheduling algorithms for performance analysis

Use Case:
- Educational tool for OS students
- Helps visualize process scheduling and analyze CPU utilization
- Useful for understanding scheduling metrics and preemption effects
